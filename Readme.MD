## Features
- Predicts car prices based on multiple factors.
- Easy-to-use interface for inputting car details.
- Visualizes model performance and feature importance.
- Displays evaluation metrics for accuracy and error rates.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes various features related to car specifications such as:
- `Make`: Car manufacturer
- `Model`: Car model
- `Year`: Year of manufacture
- `EngineSize`: Size of the carâ€™s engine
- `Mileage`: Total mileage the car has traveled
- `Transmission`: Type of transmission (manual, automatic)
- `FuelType`: Type of fuel used
- `Price`: Price of the car (target variable)

You can use a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) or any other relevant source for car data.
